## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to engineer a pipeline to analyze stock data and integrate the findings with sentiment analysis. The implication this has is being able to evaluate our data to understand and predict market trends as well as put this into practice when making more informed financial decisions.  The methods used highlight the importance of data processing, OOP principles in practice and the need to document our process.

## Project Description
This project pulls stock data obtained by the national Portuguese consumer bank. The aim of this project is to engineer a pipeline to analyze stock data and integrate the findings with sentiment analysis. The question that is answered through this process is on the reliability of the stock data to understand market trends. Stock data analysis involves extracting meaningful insight from terabytes of data. This insight is impactful for investors and policymakers to better understand and predict market trends. In the context of this project, the sentiment analysis for the daily news headlines has important impact on traders, investors and for informing economic events. 

Part of this process included data processing and cleaning in order to efficiently maintain data reliability. One of the methods used was polymorphism which is effective at keeping cleaner code. To understand the statistical characteristics of the data, we used the metrics average, median and sample standard deviation for the stock data.
